      <h3>Shareholder Proposal: Assessment of Bitcoin Adoption</h3>

      <strong>Proposal Summary</strong><br /><br />

      <p>
        We request that the Board of Directors commission a report, to be made available to shareholders by a reasonable date, assessing the potential benefits and risks of adopting Bitcoin as a part of the company's financial strategy, including but not limited to holding Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet and accepting Bitcoin for goods and services.
      </p>

      <!-- Supporting Statement -->
      <strong>Supporting Statement</strong><br /><br />

      <em>Introduction</em><br /><br />

      <p>
        In light of evolving global financial landscapes and the emergence of digital assets, it is imperative for <strong>[Company Name]</strong> to evaluate innovative financial strategies that could enhance shareholder value.
      </p>

      <em>Justifications for Bitcoin Adoption</em><br /><br />

      <strong>1. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Context:</strong> With unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation rates, traditional currencies are losing purchasing power.</li>

      </ul>

      <strong>2. Comparative Corporate Performance</strong><br />

        <li><strong>Peer Benchmarking:</strong> Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have allocated portions of their treasury into Bitcoin.</li>

        <li><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Bitcoin facilitates cross-border transactions with lower fees and faster settlement times compared to traditional banking systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>5. Fiduciary Responsibility</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximizing Shareholder Value:</strong> As fiduciaries, the Board and management have a duty to consider all viable strategies to enhance shareholder returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversification Benefits:</strong> Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets can improve the risk-adjusted returns of the company's investment portfolio.</li>

        <li><strong>Option B:</strong> Partner with payment processors to convert Bitcoin payments instantly to fiat currency, mitigating volatility risk.</li>
      </ul>
