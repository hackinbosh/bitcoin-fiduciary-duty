      <!-- Proposal Summary -->
      <h3>Shareholder Proposal: Assessment of Bitcoin Adoption</h3>

      <strong>Proposal Summary</strong><br /><br />

      We request that the Board of Directors commission a report, to be made available to shareholders by a reasonable date, assessing the potential benefits and risks of adopting Bitcoin as a part of the company's financial strategy, including but not limited to holding Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet and accepting Bitcoin for goods and services.<br /><br />

      <!-- Supporting Statement -->
      <strong>Supporting Statement</strong><br /><br />

      <em>Introduction</em><br /><br />

      In light of evolving global financial landscapes and the emergence of digital assets, it is imperative for <strong>[Company Name]</strong> to evaluate innovative financial strategies that could enhance shareholder value.<br /><br />

      <em>Justifications for Bitcoin Adoption</em><br /><br />

      <strong>1. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value</strong><br />
      - <strong>Economic Context:</strong> With unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation rates, traditional currencies are losing purchasing power.<br />
      - <strong>Bitcoin's Role:</strong> Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset by design.<br />
      - <strong>Evidence:</strong> Historical data shows Bitcoin's appreciation over the past decade, outperforming traditional inflation hedges like gold.<br /><br />

      <strong>2. Comparative Corporate Performance</strong><br />
      - <strong>Peer Benchmarking:</strong> Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have allocated portions of their treasury into Bitcoin.<br />
      - <strong>Stock Performance:</strong> MicroStrategy's stock price has significantly appreciated since its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, potentially outpacing [Company Name]'s stock performance.<br />
      - <strong>Shareholder Value:</strong> Bitcoin holdings have contributed to increased shareholder wealth in these companies.<br /><br />

      <strong>3. Institutional Adoption and Market Maturation</strong><br />
      - <strong>Regulatory Developments:</strong> Approval of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and clearer regulatory frameworks are legitimizing Bitcoin in institutional finance.<br />
      - <strong>Corporate Acceptance:</strong> Major corporations and financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their operations and service offerings.<br />
      - <strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Increased liquidity and market infrastructure reduce the operational risks associated with Bitcoin transactions.<br /><br />

      <strong>4. Customer and Market Demand</strong><br />
      - <strong>Demographic Trends:</strong> Growing consumer interest in digital currencies, especially among younger demographics.<br />
      - <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Accepting Bitcoin for goods and services can attract new customers and open up additional revenue streams.<br />
      - <strong>Global Reach:</strong> Bitcoin facilitates cross-border transactions with lower fees and faster settlement times compared to traditional banking systems.<br /><br />

      <strong>5. Fiduciary Responsibility</strong><br />
      - <strong>Maximizing Shareholder Value:</strong> As fiduciaries, the Board and management have a duty to consider all viable strategies to enhance shareholder returns.<br />
      - <strong>Diversification Benefits:</strong> Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets can improve the risk-adjusted returns of the company's investment portfolio.<br />
      - <strong>Innovation Leadership:</strong> Proactively exploring Bitcoin adoption positions [Company Name] as an innovator and leader in its industry.<br /><br />

      <em>Options for Consideration</em><br /><br />

      <strong>Treasury Allocation:</strong><br />
      - <strong>Option A:</strong> Allocate a small percentage (e.g., 1-5%) of corporate treasury reserves to Bitcoin.<br />
      - <strong>Option B:</strong> Use excess cash flows to gradually build a Bitcoin position over time.<br /><br />

      <strong>Payment Acceptance:</strong><br />
      - <strong>Option A:</strong> Begin accepting Bitcoin as payment for products and services.<br />
      - <strong>Option B:</strong> Partner with payment processors to convert Bitcoin payments instantly to fiat currency, mitigating volatility risk.<br /><br />

      <strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong><br />
      - <strong>Option A:</strong> Collaborate with fintech companies specializing in blockchain and cryptocurrency solutions.<br />
      - <strong>Option B:</strong> Invest in Bitcoin-related startups or funds to gain indirect exposure.<br /><br />

      <em>Risk Management</em><br /><br />

      - <strong>Volatility Mitigation:</strong> Utilize hedging strategies and dollar-cost averaging to reduce the impact of price fluctuations.<br />
      - <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Implement robust compliance frameworks to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations.<br />
      - <strong>Security Measures:</strong> Adopt industry best practices for digital asset custody and cybersecurity.<br /><br />

      <em>Conclusion</em><br /><br />

      By conducting a thorough assessment of Bitcoin's potential benefits and risks, [Company Name] can make an informed decision that aligns with its strategic objectives and fiduciary duties. We urge the Board to consider this proposal seriously and provide shareholders with their findings.<br /><br />
